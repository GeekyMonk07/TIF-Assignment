# Flutter Bloc Implementation

I would like to sincerely apologize for any confusion regarding the implementation of Flutter Bloc in this project. While I intended to fully implement Flutter Bloc for state management, it was only partially implemented due to unforeseen challenges.

I want to assure you that I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. I acknowledge that there is room for growth in my understanding and implementation of Flutter Bloc. I will invest the time and effort to further my knowledge and skills in this area.

In addition to Flutter Bloc, I also used Provider for state management in this project. I hope that this combination of state management tools enhances the overall user experience and functionality of the app.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your patience as I strive to provide better solutions in the future.

Sincerely,
Anmol Gangwar
